**Tools**

Tools to use: minikube or hosted k8s.


**Objective**

The idea of the test is to show your ability to run databases and microservices applications in kubernetes.

Create an application that connects to a database, reads some data and returns this data upon HTTP request.
This can be a simple web app which reads a 'hello world' string from mysql database.
Run a database app. Data volume should be persistent.
Application from step 1 needs to discover a database from step 2 using kubernetes native features.
Database credentials should NOT be hardcoded in application or helm chart code.
Application should be accessible from the outside of kubernetes.
Create a helm chart which implements all these steps and deploy via blue/green deployment.
**Solution**

Provide a link to the repository which has:

application code
helm chart
docker files 
readme
**How it will be tested**

We expect a readme which lists all the required commands to run your app locally in minikube/hosted k8s.
